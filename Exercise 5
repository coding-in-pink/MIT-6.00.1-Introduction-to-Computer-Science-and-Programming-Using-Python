ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE: 4 minutes

Here is a different piece of code for working with lists:

def applyEachTo(L, x):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(L)):
        result.append(L[i](x))
    return result
    
Suppose that you are given the following functions:

def square(a):
    return a*a

def halve(a):
    return a/2

def inc(a):
    return a+1
For each of the following questions, indicate what value is returned. If you believe that an error will occur,
write the word 'error'.
"""

1- applyEachTo([inc, square, halve, abs], -3)

Answer:[-2, 9, -1.5, 3]

2-applyEachTo([inc, square, halve, abs], 3.0)

Answer:[4.0, 9.0, 1.5, 3.0]

applyEachTo([inc, max, int], -3)

Answer:error
