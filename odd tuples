Exercise: odd tuples
0.0/5.0 points (graded)
ESTIMATED TIME TO COMPLETE: 5 minutes

Write a procedure called oddTuples, which takes a tuple as input, and returns a new tuple as output, where every other element
of the input tuple is copied, starting with the first one. So if test is the tuple 
('I', 'am', 'a', 'test', 'tuple'), then evaluating oddTuples on this input would return the tuple ('I', 'a', 'tuple').

# My code:

def oddTuples(aTup):
    '''
    aTup: a tuple
     
    returns: tuple, every other element of aTup. 
    '''
      return aTup[::2]
      
      # Output of this code is:
      
 runfile('C:/Users/Hp/while exercise 1/odd tuple 2. way.py', wdir='C:/Users/Hp/while exercise 1')

aTup=('I', 'am', 'a', 'test', 'tuple')

aTup[::2]
Out[1]: ('I', 'a', 'tuple')

#Correct.

#Another way to solve the problem.

# a placeholder to gather our response
    rTup = ()
    index = 0

    # Idea: Iterate over the elements in aTup, counting by 2
    #  (every other element) and adding that element to 
    #  the result
    while index < len(aTup):
        rTup += (aTup[index],)
        index += 2

    return rTup
